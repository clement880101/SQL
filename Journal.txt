3/6 We seperated the entry form from summary form so that reload will not be the same as re submit
3/9 I learned about the secure password entry system. The password will be scrabled so that the people
with access to the db cannot see the password.
3/13 Using the things we learn from last class, we set up the register form. THe password we entered will be
encrpyted and saved in the DB.
3/16 This class, we try to set up the login form. Using cookie and get, we can pass login information between forms.
When user enter the password, the password will be encrypted to be compared with the password stored in db.
If all entry are correct, the username info will be passed to the welcome page. Then, the welcome page iwll display
the username.
